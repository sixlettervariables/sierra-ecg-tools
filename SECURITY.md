# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Support is provided for each of the Sierra ECG tools on an as-needed basis, as all versions are delivered in source form.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security issues and bugs should be reported privately to the author by emailing christopher.watford@gmail.com.
You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure they received your
original message.

Please do not open issues for anything you think might have a security implication.
